# Falling Sand Game  

This is a **Falling Sand** simulation built using **Python**, **Pygame**, and **Random**. It simulates the behavior of various particles falling and interacting with each other, similar to the classic falling sand games. The game allows users to add particles like sand, water, fire, and more to the simulation.
